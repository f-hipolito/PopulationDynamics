# PopulationDynamics
Repository dedicated to my notes and analysis of population dynamics, focusing
on the propagation of CoViD19.

Main reference file for this project is PopulationDynamics.ipynb, it contains
all relevant information and points to other relevant files.

While the primary focus is the propagation of CoViD19, the model is general
and easy to apply to any population whose growth is governed by a differential
equation relating the rate of change of population to separable function of
time and population.
