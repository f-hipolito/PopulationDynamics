# PopulationDynamics
Repository dedicated to my notes and analysis of population dynamics, focusing
on the propagation of CoViD19.

Main reference file for this project is
[_PopulationDynamics.ipynb_](https://github.com/f-hipolito/PopulationDynamics/blob/master/Population_dynamics.ipynb),
it contains all relevant information and points to other relevant files.

While the primary focus is the propagation of CoViD19, the model is general
and easy to apply to any population whose growth is governed by a differential
equation relating the rate of change of population to separable function of
time and population.


## Data source:
We collected our data from two sources.
First data source, used up to 2020-05-13 is the _European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control_ (ECDC).
Second data source, used from 2020-05-13 until present is the _datahub.io_
dataset on [CoViD19](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19).
This is sourced from this upstream repository maintained by the team at
[Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/) (JHU CSSE)

Primary reason to changing to the JHU CSSE data set was the absence of recovered
data in the ECDC dataset.


Data is publicly available at:
* _datahub.io/covid-19_ available at [github repository](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19)
  1. the original dataset from JHU CSSE is available at
  [github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Code organization and programming language
As this project grew in size, I decided to move all code to external files,
thus dedicating this primary notebook to theory and discussion.
The results discussed in this file are generated by the following notebooks
* Korea.ipynb
* Denmark.ipynb
* Portugal.ipynb

that can be found in the root folder for this project.

User defined auxiliary function are made available via two modules
* MyFunctions.jl: general purpose user defined functions;
* Mrate.jl: dedicated to m-steady state model.

All code was written with Julia 1.4.0, for reference see the
[official documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.4/).
Additional required packages and modules (for Julia only):
* SpecialFunctions
* MyFunctions, Mrate (local modules provided in the repository)
* DataFrames, Query, CSV, Dates
* LsqFit, Optim
* Plots, LaTeXStrings
A python 3.x version is in the pipeline, but priority is given to project
development using Julia.
