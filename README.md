# PopulationDynamics
Repository dedicated to my notes and analysis of population dynamics, focusing
on the propagation of CoViD19.

Main reference file for this project is
[_PopulationDynamics.ipynb_](https://github.com/f-hipolito/PopulationDynamics/blob/master/Population_dynamics.ipynb),
it contains all relevant information and points to other relevant files.

While the primary focus is the propagation of CoViD19, the model is general
and easy to apply to any population whose growth is governed by a differential
equation relating the rate of change of population to separable function of
time and population.


## Data source:
We collected our data from the publicly available data _European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control_ (ECDC)
[site](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)
for daily updates on CoViD19 cases.

Datasets
* _aRnzjSwT_ collected on 2020-04-17T21:29
* _6u83xREK_ collected on 2020-04-25T16:41

Upon accessing the datasets sha256 checksum were generated locally to verify
data integrity, the check sums are available in attached file _sha256sums_.

## Code organization and programming language
As this project grew in size, I decided to move all code to external files,
thus dedicating this primary notebook to theory and discussion.
The results discussed in this file are generated by the following notebooks
* Korea.ipynb
* Denmark.ipynb
* Portugal.ipynb

that can be found in the root folder for this project.

User defined auxiliary function are made available via two modules
* MyFunctions.jl: general purpose user defined functions;
* Mrate.jl: dedicated to m-steady state model.

All code was written with Julia 1.4.0, for reference see the
[official documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.4/).
Additional required packages and modules (for Julia only):
* SpecialFunctions
* MyFunctions, Mrate (local modules provided in the repository)
* DataFrames, Query, CSV, Dates
* LsqFit, Optim
* Plots, LaTeXStrings
A python 3.x version is in the pipeline, but priority is given to project
development using Julia.
