    "\n",

    "perspective we can, and should, analyze it with fairly simple models \n",
    "containing few parameters that can be mapped to our understanding of \n",
    "reality, _e.g._ incubation times, policy change dates, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed (and demonstrated) below, the logistic function is the solution \n",

    "This assumption is incompatible with propagation of CoViD19, as every country\n",
    "in the world is implementing some sort mitigation policies to reduce the\n",
    "growth rate of the infection.\n",
