    "(primarily focused on population growth) and how to apply first order\n",
    "differential equations to characterize to such problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is my understanding that before addressing this problem from an ML \n",
    "perspective we can, and should, analyze it with fairly simple models \n",

    "In this notebook I delve into the generalization of a logistic model to\n",
    "overcome a key limitation of this model, namely the assumption of constant\n",
    "environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed (and demonstrated) below, the logistic function is the solution \n",

    "## 2. Brief review of the relevant differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The present notebook concerns only population dynamics where the rate of change\n",

    "coefficients. \n",
    "Without loss of generality the differential equation that governs such processes\n",
    "reads $$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = F(t,n) \\, ,$$ where $F(t,n)$ encodes the dependence on\n",
    "$t$ and  $n$. Since we are considering a polynomial dependence on $n$ with\n",
    "constant coefficients, $F(t,n)$ can be expressed by two separable functions for\n",

    "$C$ is an integration constant.\n",
    "To proceed, we must define $Q(n)$ and $P(t)$. For constant environment (steady\n",
    "state) problems, the rate of change has to be independent of time, ie \n",
    "$dP(t)/dt=0$.\n",
    "In this scenario, we find the differential equation for classic undergraduate \n",

    "\n",
    "### Constant environment assumption\n",
